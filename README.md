 TODO:
- [] Think about how we might be able to use MIR to improve transcription. Could be use repetition detection to improve transcription? Could we make some assumptions about drum patterns in sections of songs being repeated? Could we train a secondary model to figure out the most likely form for a given section or simply train on repeated sections and feed what we think are sections into the transcription model?

- [ ] Can we use data augmentation to make the most of the training data we have?

- [ ] Make a plan to prioritize which ideas to work on first based on likely impact and feasibility/effort.
